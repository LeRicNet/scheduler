# Scheduler
### Kivy Based Application for Scheduling Machine Space
### 
-------------------------------------
#### Objective

There is a common-use instrument that is currently being scheduled using a shared Google Drive.  There is always confusion about how to properly read the color coded system.  To remedy this, I will create a Kivy based application that will handle the scheduling in a more intuitive, graphics-based approach.
